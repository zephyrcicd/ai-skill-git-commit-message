# Git Commit Message Skills

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A shareable AI skill repo for generating Git commit messages from conversation context and the current git diff.

Recommended install style: Git-first. Clone the repo locally, then follow the platform-specific guide for your tool.

It ships two related skills:

- `ggm` - generate a concise commit message only
- `ggm-p` - generate a commit message, check the relevant files, and commit automatically when the privacy check passes

## What These Skills Do

These skills help an AI agent combine:

- the latest task discussed in the conversation
- the actual staged or unstaged git changes in the repository
- Conventional Commit best practices
- optional scoped commit style such as `feat(ship): ...`

`ggm-p` adds an extra guarded flow:

- selects only files relevant to the current change
- checks selected files for likely personal privacy leakage before commit
- runs `git commit` automatically if no likely privacy issue is found
- skips commit and warns if likely privacy leakage is detected
- never runs `git push`

## Features

- Generates concise Conventional Commit messages such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, and `chore:`
- Adds scope when the changed domain is clear, such as `feat(ship): ...`
- Prefers the real git diff over vague conversational intent when they conflict
- Follows the dominant language used in the last 3 user messages when generating commit messages, with fallback to broader recent context
- Works with both Claude Code and Codex
- Keeps `ggm` and `ggm-p` separate so message-only and commit-assisted flows stay explicit

## Example Outputs

```text
feat(ship): add batch label sync
fix(auth): prevent refresh token loop
refactor(search): extract query normalization
chore: clean up unused feature flags
```

## Install

Installation differs by platform. Claude Code uses a marketplace flow. Codex and OpenCode are best installed by telling the agent to fetch platform-specific instructions. Gemini CLI uses its native extension install flow.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add zephyrcicd/ai-skill-git-commit-message
claude plugin install git-commit-message@git-skills
```

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zephyrcicd/ai-skill-git-commit-message/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

Detailed guide: `docs/install-codex.md`

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zephyrcicd/ai-skill-git-commit-message/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

Detailed guide: `docs/install-opencode.md`

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/zephyrcicd/ai-skill-git-commit-message
```

To update:

```bash
gemini extensions update git-commit-message
```

Detailed guide: `docs/install-gemini-cli.md`

### Updating

See `docs/update.md`.

### Tell Another AI To Install It

Use the file that matches the target CLI:

- Codex: `docs/tell-ai-codex.md`
- Claude Code: `docs/tell-ai-claude-code.md`
- OpenCode: `docs/tell-ai-opencode.md`
- Gemini CLI: `docs/tell-ai-gemini-cli.md`

Each file contains a single copy-ready prompt for that specific platform.

## Usage

```text
$ggm
```

```text
$ggm-p
```

## Repository Layout

```

## Choosing Between Them

Use `ggm` when you only want the commit message.

Use `ggm-p` when you want the model to:

- generate the message
- narrow the commit to relevant files
- check those selected files for likely privacy leakage
- run `git commit` automatically when the privacy check passes
